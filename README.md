# K-means Clustering from Scratch for FIFA Team Building

This GitHub repository contains the implementation of K-means clustering from scratch and a comparison with the `sklearn` library. The main goal is to create a FIFA team using player data from the "FIFA 22 Complete Player Dataset".

## Introduction

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to partition a set of data points into clusters. In this project, we apply K-means clustering to group FIFA players based on their attributes and use these clusters to build a FIFA team.

## Google Colab Notebook

The implementation, explanation, results and next steps can be found in the [Google Colab notebook (k_means_clustering.ipynb)](https://colab.research.google.com/link-to-your-colab-notebook).

## Dataset Download

The FIFA 22 Complete Player Dataset can be downloaded from the [data folder](data /data) in this repository or directly from the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset).
